//! THE HEADER PRESENTATION: `bearer`, `api-key`, `x-goog-api-key`, and a dialect's credential-family
//! table. MOVED VERBATIM from the identity unit's `egress_auth/mod.rs` in the kernel (the header builders
//! and their one legality rule) and `.../declared.rs` (the credential-family presentation,
//! `presentation`/`present`), staged `busbar-auth-outbound::present` (KERNEL<>PLUGINS step 22), then
//! here (AUTH-SPLIT: bearer/api-key/x-goog-api-key are one mechanism, header presentation, and this
//! is its own crate). The legality rule itself, [`is_legal_header_value`](busbar_contract::header::is_legal_header_value),
//! lives in `busbar-contract` now, a shared pure helper: `busbar-auth-sigv4` and
//! `busbar-auth-oauth` need the same byte rule.
//!
//! What did NOT move: the `Grant<Sign>` / `SecretSlot` / `substitute` indirection. It existed so the
//! kernel could write a secret onto a request without a plane ever holding it; the auth plugin
//! holds the credential itself (BUSBAR-1.6.0.md THE DESIGN, §6: "The auth plugin holds it"), so the header is built
//! here directly — the same bytes `decorate` + `substitute` wrote, which the ported
//! `*_builder_and_decorated_slot_agree_on_every_key` vectors pin.
